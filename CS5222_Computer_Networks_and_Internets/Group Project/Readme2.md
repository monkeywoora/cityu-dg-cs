# CS5222 Computer Networks Project

It is a kind of honor of my own to make cooperations with my partner in order to complete the project.

On the basis of the regulations, we independently completed the writing of the necessary code, and at the same time we added a new "JUMP" module.

The client is written in python.

## Details

- The server runs on `127.0.0.1` port `16111`.
- You can test the server-client connection by
    - directly running the server and client on the same machine, or
    - connecting two machines in the same network, and enter the server's private IP address in the client, or
    - using a virtual machine to achieve the same effect as the previous method.
- For instructions on establishing a connection, please read the related documents.
- Tested on Python 3.9.1 on Windows 10.
- The "JUMP" function module is similar to jumping to different buildings in a blog, and after entering the specified information ID, the corresponding information ID will pop up.
