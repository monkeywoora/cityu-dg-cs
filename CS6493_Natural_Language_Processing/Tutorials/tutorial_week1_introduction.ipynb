    "You can use Google Colab to run the toy models. Here are some important notes for using Colab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are expected to be familiar with Python and Jupyter.\n",
    "- We will use **Google Colab** for the following experiments. Please run the experiments in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  \n",
    "  (If you do not have a Google Account, please register for one.)\n",
    "- Please go to **Edit -> Notebook Settings** and select Python 3 and GPU as the hardware accelerator.\n",
    "- Before running a specific model, check the resources you need and compare them with the available resources by using **!nvidia-smi**.\n",
    "- We will be happy to assist you throughout the tutorial, so please feel free to ask any questions you may have.\n",
